        Ever since I was a kid, I've loved taking things apart and putting them back together, figuring out how their components build into a cohesive end product. My early interest in learning how systems later evolved into assembling my first desktop computer at age 13, and subsequently taking four years of CAD-focused mechanical engineering classes throughout high school. I later pursued a mathematics-heavy major in ecological engineering at Colorado State University for four semesters, in hopes of learning the skills to effectively address our many looming large-scale environmental crises. After two years in engineering courses, I switched majors to the science of restoration ecology, which was well-supported by what I learned in my engineering courses and still geared towards my passion for the environment. I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Restoration Ecology.

        Throughout my schooling and beyond, I have always been a self-starter, pursuing a diversity of independent ventures in freelancing, nonprofits, and the arts (music, film, and graphic design). As one of these many ventures, I co-founded and currently serve as the Director of Media Production for educational 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization <a href="https://theechofilm.com/" target="_blank">The Echo</a>. I started The Echo as a university-recognized independent study for college credit in 2015 with my fellow student, Matthew Juneau. My contributions to out nonprofit mission have spanned across many disciplines, including but not limited to video production, audio production, graphic design, marketing, fundraising, and administration. As The Echo's Director of Media Production, my efforts have been guided by the organization's paramount objective of educating the public about animals. I've overseen The Echo's production of short-form documentaries, social media content, live-streamed fundraisers, and most recently a podcast called <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

        Beyond my work in nonprofits, I have also contributed to the ongoing evolution of the Fort Collins music scene. As a valued member of this community, I co-founded and served as drummer-producer for independent progressive rock band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>. From 2016 to 2021, we achieved an impressive reputation within the music scene, playing over 70 shows, performing 2 regional tours, and self-producing 3 albums. Building a sustainable independent music business required me to use many of the same skills as with The Echo, in addition to things like music performance, event production, and logistics. Outside of my band, I have also released music as a solo artist in various genres.

        In addition to music, I have also spearheaded numerous cross-disciplinary projects within the broader art community, utilizing my extensive network of collaborators both locally & remotely. From producing & releasing a <a href="https://youtu.be/QnNKP_V6nk4?si=BaFzXWChfa8yjkiH" target="_blank">song written specifically to a piece of visual art</a>, to heading the conceptualization & production of a <a href="https://youtu.be/YLYVKDfBAy8?si=ugd0oRHI07OwBt5O">dramatic short film</a>, to various other projects, I have established myself as prolific & adaptable collaborator.

        As a necessity to the success of my entrepreneurial pursuits, I taught myself how to build websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To expand upon this knowledge, I decided to attend <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s live in-person Software Engineering boot camp over the winter of 2022-2023. During the program, my classmates & instructors came to know me as someone who is both friendly & knowledgeable. I facilitated frequent group learning sessions and provided individual guidance to classmates, which bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts. After earning my certificate in February of 2023, I immediately picked up freelance web development work to reinforce & advance what I had learned, in both front end & back end contexts. Please see <a href="#projects">My Projects</a> below for more details on my freelance software development work.

        Having spent well over a decade pursuing a variety of independent ventures, I've cultivated a multifaceted & exceedingly valuable perspective on sociotechnical project management. When seeking work, I emphasize my broad professional background & diverse <a href="#skills">skill set</a>, both of which allow me to operate & communicate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of software, audio, video, and graphic design. In addition to my hard skills, my experience in creative entrepreneurship has culminated into an astute awareness of how human & digital systems can communicate & collaborate, both efficiently & efficaciously. As I continue to nurture my passion for software development, I look forward to contributing my technical & interpersonal skills to this ever-evolving field!
